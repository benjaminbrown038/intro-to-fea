# fea project

A foundational MATLAB finite element analysis framework that implements the core FEA workflow: geometry definition, mesh generation, stiffness matrix assembly, boundary condition application, solving for nodal displacements, and post-processing of strain and stress.

It is designed as a learning and extensible base project, typically starting with simple linear elastic problems (often 1D or very simple 2D), and serves as the backbone from which the more advanced 2D, triangular, adaptive, and 3D FEA projects are built.

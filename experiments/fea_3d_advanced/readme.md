# fea 3d advanced 

A high-fidelity MATLAB finite element analysis project that extends 3D solid mechanics to nonlinear and multiphysics behavior. It supports thermal–mechanical coupling, multi-material domains, nonlinear material models (e.g., plasticity or temperature-dependent properties), and complex boundary conditions.

The project incorporates iterative solvers, incremental loading, and advanced post-processing such as principal stresses, von Mises stress, and transient response visualization, making it suitable for research-level studies and realistic engineering simulations beyond basic linear FEA.

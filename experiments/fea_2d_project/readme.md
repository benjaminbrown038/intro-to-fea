# fea 2d project

A MATLAB-based 2D finite element analysis solver for planar solid mechanics.
It models structures using 2D elements (triangular or quadrilateral) under plane stress or plane strain assumptions, solves for nodal displacements (uₓ, uᵧ), computes element strains and stresses, and visualizes results using stress contour plots (e.g., von Mises).

Typical uses: plates, brackets, cross-sections, and validation of FEA fundamentals before moving to 3D.

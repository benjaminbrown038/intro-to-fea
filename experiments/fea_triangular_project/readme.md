# fea triangular project

A 2D finite element analysis MATLAB project based on 3-node linear triangular elements, enabling simulation of structures with arbitrary geometries. The project generates triangular meshes (e.g., via Delaunay triangulation), solves for nodal displacements in x and y, computes element strains and stresses, and visualizes results using color contour plots (such as von Mises stress).

It represents a realistic step toward commercial FEA workflows and serves as a foundation for extensions like thermal loading, multi-material domains, adaptive meshing, and multiphysics coupling.

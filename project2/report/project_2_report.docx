PDF file containing the following items:
o Clearly defined geometry and conditions. This includes:
▪ All nodal and elemental numbering schemes.
▪ Selected boundary conditions (location and values)
▪ Conductivity (k)
o Results:
▪ Nodal temperatures (both MATLAB and APDL)
• Original MATLAB scripts used to produce the results.
• APDL script (.txt) used for comparison.

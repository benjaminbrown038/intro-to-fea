# Tier 9 – Research-Level & Data-Driven FEA

Overview:


Integrates FEA with data-driven approaches such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and operator learning for inverse problems, optimization, and surrogate modeling.


Key Features: PDE surrogates, inverse boundary/property recovery, shape optimization, fast prediction of stress/strain/temperature fields, multi-physics data-driven workflows.

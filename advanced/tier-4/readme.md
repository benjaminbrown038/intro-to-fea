# Tier 4 – 3D Linear Elastic FEA


Overview:

Introduces 3D elements for volumetric solids. Users solve for 3D displacements, compute element stresses and strains, and visualize results in three dimensions.


Key Features: Cuboid or tetrahedral elements, 3D nodal displacements, element strain/stress computation, basic 3D visualization.

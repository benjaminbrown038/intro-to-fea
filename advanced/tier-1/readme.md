# Tier 1 – Basic FEA Foundations

Overview:


Introduces the fundamentals of finite element analysis (FEA) with simple 1D or 2D problems. Focuses on solving basic PDEs, understanding nodal displacements, and computing element strains and stresses.


Key Features: Linear elasticity, simple geometries, uniform mesh, basic boundary conditions, displacement & stress visualization.
